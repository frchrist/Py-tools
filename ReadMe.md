# Py-tools

Welcome to our Python application! This project aims to create a robust and efficient utility tool that simplifies tedious tasks and automates workflows using the customtkinter library to build a graphical user interface.

The project was built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which allows us to separate the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and the data (Model). This separation of concerns enables us to easily scale the application, making it more maintainable and testable.
